# Scripts used in paper Multi-year Seasonal Trends in Sea Ice, Chlorophyll Concentration, and Marine Aerosol Optical Depth in the Bellingshausen Sea
These scripts are authored by S. Dasarathy. 
This repository contains my calculation and processing of Clean Marine Aerosol Optical Depth (MAOD), chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a), wind speed, & sea ice as surface integrated depolarization ratio. 
These variables and techniques take advantage of a wide suite of data available from remote sensing instruments including NASA CALIOP, MODIS Aqua, and the AMSR-E.
